# The-SQL-Station

My Collection of SQL queries.

This SQL folder is a collection of my commonly used queries for various databases. It includes both basic and advanced queries for data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis. The queries are well-organized and commented for easy reference and understanding. 

This folder can be used as a resource for developers and data analysts to quickly access and utilize commonly used SQL commands in their projects.
